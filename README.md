You can download and modify namesets.txt to add your DIY nicknames for champs or simply use the EXE file which uses the online version of namesets.txt in github as default. (EXE file and namesets.txt should be in the same directory if you want to use a local version.) 
I used PyInstaller to generate the EXE file.
